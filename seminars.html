        <H3>Predictions in Eternally Inflating Universe</H3>
        
        In generic models of cosmological inflation, quantum fluctuations 
        strongly influence the spacetime metric and produce infinitely many 
        regions where the end of inflation (reheating) is delayed until 
        arbitrarily late times. The geometry of the resulting spacetime is 
        highly inhomogeneous on scales of many Hubble sizes. The recently 
        developed string-theoretic picture of the "landscape" presents a 
        similar structure, where an infinite number of de Sitter and anti-de 
        Sitter universes are nucleated via gravitational quantum tunneling. 
        Since
        observers on the Earth have no information about their position within 
        the eternally inflating landscape, the main question in this context 
        is to obtain statistical predictions for quantities observed at a 
        random location within the landscape. I describe the problems arising 
        within this statistical framework, in particular, the need for a 
        volume cut-off and the dependence of certain cut-off schemes on time 
        slicing and on the initial conditions. I review the existing proposals 
        for extracting predictions and give examples of their applications, in 
        particular, to the cosmological constant problem.
