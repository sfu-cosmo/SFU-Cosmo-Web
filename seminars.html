        <H3>Dark Energy and the Rubber Band </H3>
        
        There is now strong evidence for an unknown form of dark energy
        pervading the universe. However, the microphyical explanation of
        this dark energy remains a mystery. The dark energy cannot be a
        normal fluid, as this leads to instabilities on the smallest scales.
        In this talk I discuss the possibilty that the dark energy takes the
        form of an elastic medium. I explain the theoretical framework and
        cosmological signatures of such a model, and also discuss the possibility
        that the microphyical origin is a tangled network of cosmic strings
        and domain walls.

        <H3>Predictions in Eternally Inflating Universe</H3>
        
        In generic models of cosmological inflation, quantum fluctuations 
        strongly influence the spacetime metric and produce infinitely many 
        regions where the end of inflation (reheating) is delayed until 
        arbitrarily late times. The geometry of the resulting spacetime is 
        highly inhomogeneous on scales of many Hubble sizes. The recently 
        developed string-theoretic picture of the "landscape" presents a 
        similar structure, where an infinite number of de Sitter and anti-de 
        Sitter universes are nucleated via gravitational quantum tunneling. 
        Since
        observers on the Earth have no information about their position within 
        the eternally inflating landscape, the main question in this context 
        is to obtain statistical predictions for quantities observed at a 
        random location within the landscape. I describe the problems arising 
        within this statistical framework, in particular, the need for a 
        volume cut-off and the dependence of certain cut-off schemes on time 
        slicing and on the initial conditions. I review the existing proposals 
        for extracting predictions and give examples of their applications, in 
        particular, to the cosmological constant problem.

        <H3>Relativistic Binary Pulsars</H3>
        
        Radio pulsars in double-neutron-star systems provide the best tests
        of strong-field gravitational theories.  I will present recent
        observations of PSR B1534+12 and the double-pulsar system J0737-3039A/B.
        In both cases, the pulsar timing observations are sensitive to multiple
        relativistic corrections to the basic Keplerian orbit, and therefore
        yield multiple tests of general relativity, with the double pulsar
        providing the strongest test to date.  I will also discuss
        observations of geodetic precession and implications for the
        formation of the two systems.

        <H3>The role of SUSY flat directions in reheating</H3>
        
        Reheating after inflation describes all the particle physics
        processes occurring from the decay of the inflaton up to the
        establishment of thermal equilibrium. Due to the strong model
        dependence, it is one of the most unknown stages in the history of the
        universe. There is ongoing effort to determine the reheating temperature
        within different scenarios (from this quantity, one can then determine
        the amount of baryons and of unwanted relics, such as gravitinos,
        produced by the thermal bath). It has been argued that SUSY flat
        directions are naturally excited during inflation, and that they slow
        down thermalization, by providing a large effective mass to the fields
        they are coupled to. We discuss a nonperturbative decay channel for the
        flat directions which has been generally overlooked in the literature.
        It typically leads to a quick decay of the flat directions, and,
        arguably, to a suppression of their delaying effect for thermalization.

        <H3>Submillimetre galaxies and star-formation in the early Universe</H3>
        
        Submm galaxies recently have been discovered in significant numbers using
        SCUBA, the sub-millimetre common-user bolometer array on the James Clerk
        Maxwell Telescope, Hawaii. Their spectra closely resemble 30-40K black-body;
        they are believed to be dust-shrouded progenitor galaxies with the dust
        heated by UV radiation from early generations of stars. If this is so,
        then star-forming rates in each pre-galaxy must be prodigious, say 1000
        solar masses per year. The present day equivalents are suggested to be
        the so-called ULIRGs, ultra-luminous IR galaxies, such as NGC 6240 or
        Arp 220, whose enormous star-formation rates are attributed to major
        galaxy mergers. At last we have a ~completely identified sample of 35
        submm galaxies, and my talk will describe how this sample - despite
        its small size - has enabled us to learn much about the cosmic space
        distribution and evolution of this key population of proto-galaxies.

        <H3>Supersymmetry for particle physicists</H3>
        
        The idea of  Supersymmetry, together with the theoretical motivations for
        its introduction, is presented in a way that puts an emphasis on the main
        concepts rather than the technical details. The observational consequences
        of Supersymmetry, past searches, existing limits and prospects for possible
        observation of Supersymmetric particles in experiments at Large Hadron
        Collider at CERN are summarized.

        <H3>Aspects of nonlinear perturbation theory in cosmology</H3>
        
        I will review recent suggestions that nonlinear cosmological
        perturbations are important in slow-roll inflation models. Closely
        related issues in pure de Sitter spacetime will also be discussed,
        with the upshot that a reasonable notion of perturbative consistency
        directly implies a disturbing absence of nontrivial dynamics in de
        Sitter spacetime. The scope of the talk will be introductory.
