    Our webpage is still under construction. We will be bringing content online over the next few months.
    For now, we would like to advertise a postdoc opening in our group starting next year. We are also looking
    for prospective graduate students. If you are interested in studying cosmology, talk to us.

    <H2>Postdoctoral Position in Theoretical Cosmology and Astrophysics</H2>
    
    <P>
    The newly formed theoretical cosmology group at the
    <A HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</A>
    <A HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/physics">Physics Department</A>
    expects to have a postdoctoral position with a starting
    date in the Fall, 2007. The group includes
    <A HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/~frolov">Andrei Frolov</A>,
    <A HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/~levon">Levon Pogosian</A>, and
    <A HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/physics/faculty/trottier.html">Howard Trottier</A>,
    and has active research interests in observational tests of
    fundamental theories, early universe, cosmic structure formation,
    astroparticle physics, black holes and topological defects. While an overlap
    with the interests of the group is desired, strong consideration will be given
    to applicants with demonstrated ability for independent research in any area
    of theoretical cosmology and astrophysics. The appointment is for two years,
    with a possibility of extension for another year contingent on performance and
    availability of funds.
    </P>
    
    <P>
    Applicants are required to send a CV, publication list, a statement of research interest,
    and arrange for 3 letters of reference to be sent electronically (plain text or PDF) to
    <A HREF="mailto:cosmo-search@sfu.ca">cosmo-search@sfu.ca</A> or by regular mail to:
