Probing Dark Matter and Dark Energy with weak gravitational lensing

Cosmology is the scientific study of the Universe, striving to answer the most
fundamental questions about its origin, history and future.  Already we know
that only a small fraction of our Universe is made up of the material that we
are familiar with on Earth.  The rest is made up of an unknown Dark Matter
component that surrounds all galaxies, and an unknown Dark Energy component that
is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the Universe.  Measuring the
exact quantities of each of our Universe's components is the great achievement
of modern day Cosmology, revealing a rather sad fate for the Universe; it will
simply expand forever becoming colder and emptier.  That we have no grasp of the
nature and origin of dark matter or dark energy however remains rather
unsatisfactory!

<BR><BR>
In this talk I will describe a new technique, called `weak gravitational
lensing', that can not only detect dark matter but also has the great promise of
being able to measure the properties of dark energy.  I will discuss the physics
that underpins this method and present maps of the distribution of dark matter
across an area of sky the size of the full moon. I will also describe an
exciting future NASA mission that will utilize this lensing technique to uncover
the origin of the mysterious dark energy.

"The Neutron Star in 1930 -- and Today (colloquium) - <FONT COLOR="red">CANCELLED</FONT>"

The neutron had not yet been discovered in 1930, but it might have been.
To understand neutron stars simply it is fun to ask how much could have
been predicted about their properties if it had. After using this
fictional device to introduce neutron stars, we will fast forward to
today, where some of the issues remain the same as we could have deduced
in 1930, but others are more subtle -- and potentially revealing about
high density nuclear physics.

"Dynamics of the r mode instability of neutron stars - <FONT COLOR="red">CANCELLED</FONT>"

One of the most important questions in high energy astrophysics is what
sets the fastest possible rotational frequencies of neutron stars.
Although requiring stability against rotational mass shedding set
absolute upper bounds, for most equations of state these seem to be well
above the fastest observed rotational frequencies. The r-mode -- a
Rossby wave in a rotating fluid -- is destabilized via the emission of
gravitational radiation in neutron stars at rotation rates below the
absolute upper bounds. This talk will treat the important topic of how
the instability saturates, which determines whether gravitational
radiation is detectable from neutron stars suffering from this
instability. Moreover, the question of whether the instability is ``too
strong'' will also be discussed -- and what that might mean for neutron
star physics.

Dark Energy and the Rubber Band

There is now strong evidence for an unknown form of dark energy
pervading the universe. However, the microphysical explanation of this
dark energy remains a mystery. The dark energy cannot be a normal fluid,
as this leads to instabilities on the smallest scales. In this talk I
discuss the possibility that the dark energy takes the form of an elastic
medium. I explain the theoretical framework and cosmological signatures
of such a model, and also discuss the possibility that the microphysical
origin is a tangled network of cosmic strings and domain walls.

Aspects of nonlinear perturbation theory in cosmology

I will review recent suggestions that nonlinear cosmological
perturbations are important in slow-roll inflation models. Closely
related issues in pure de Sitter spacetime will also be discussed,
with the upshot that a reasonable notion of perturbative consistency
directly implies a disturbing absence of nontrivial dynamics in de
Sitter spacetime. The scope of the talk will be introductory.

Supersymmetry for particle physicists

The idea of Supersymmetry, together with the theoretical motivations for
its introduction, is presented in a way that puts an emphasis on the
main concepts rather than the technical details. The observational
consequences of Supersymmetry, past searches, existing limits and
prospects for possible observation of Supersymmetric particles in
experiments at Large Hadron Collider at CERN are summarized.

Submillimetre galaxies and star-formation in the early Universe

Submm galaxies recently have been discovered in significant numbers
using SCUBA, the sub-millimetre common-user bolometer array on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope, Hawaii. Their spectra closely resemble 30-40K
black-body; they are believed to be dust-shrouded progenitor galaxies
with the dust heated by UV radiation from early generations of stars. If
this is so, then star-forming rates in each pre-galaxy must be
prodigious, say 1000 solar masses per year. The present day equivalents
are suggested to be the so-called ULIRGs, ultra-luminous IR galaxies,
such as NGC 6240 or Arp 220, whose enormous star-formation rates are
attributed to major galaxy mergers. At last we have a completely
identified sample of 35 submm galaxies, and my talk will describe how
this sample - despite its small size - has enabled us to learn much
about the cosmic space distribution and evolution of this key population
of proto-galaxies.

The role of SUSY flat directions in reheating

Reheating after inflation describes all the particle physics processes
occurring from the decay of the inflaton up to the establishment of
thermal equilibrium. Due to the strong model dependence, it is one of
the most unknown stages in the history of the universe. There is ongoing
effort to determine the reheating temperature within different scenarios
(from this quantity, one can then determine the amount of baryons and of
unwanted relics, such as gravitinos, produced by the thermal bath). It
has been argued that SUSY flat directions are naturally excited during
inflation, and that they slow down thermalization, by providing a large
effective mass to the fields they are coupled to. We discuss a
nonperturbative decay channel for the flat directions which has been
generally overlooked in the literature. It typically leads to a quick
decay of the flat directions, and, arguably, to a suppression of their
delaying effect for thermalization.

Relativistic Binary Pulsars

Radio pulsars in double-neutron-star systems provide the best tests of
strong-field gravitational theories. I will present recent observations
of PSR B1534+12 and the double-pulsar system J0737-3039A/B. In both
cases, the pulsar timing observations are sensitive to multiple
relativistic corrections to the basic Keplerian orbit, and therefore
yield multiple tests of general relativity, with the double pulsar
providing the strongest test to date. I will also discuss observations
of geodetic precession and implications for the formation of the two
systems.

Predictions in Eternally Inflating Universe

In generic models of cosmological inflation, quantum fluctuations
strongly influence the spacetime metric and produce infinitely many
regions where the end of inflation (reheating) is delayed until
arbitrarily late times. The geometry of the resulting spacetime is
highly inhomogeneous on scales of many Hubble sizes. The recently
developed string-theoretic picture of the "landscape" presents a similar
structure, where an infinite number of de Sitter and anti-de Sitter
universes are nucleated via gravitational quantum tunneling. Since
observers on the Earth have no information about their position within
the eternally inflating landscape, the main question in this context is
to obtain statistical predictions for quantities observed at a random
location within the landscape. I describe the problems arising within
this statistical framework, in particular, the need for a volume cut-off
and the dependence of certain cut-off schemes on time slicing and on the
initial conditions. I review the existing proposals for extracting
predictions and give examples of their applications, in particular, to
the cosmological constant problem.
