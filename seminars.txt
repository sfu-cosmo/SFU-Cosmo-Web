An alternative to inflation: matter bounce cosmology

In this talk, I will introduce the basic idea of matter bounce and its
specific realization by applying a Lee-Wick scalar in the early universe.
As an alternative to inflation, matter bounce can give a scale-invariant
spectrum required by CMB observations as inflation did. Moreover, it
predicts large and negative non-gaussianities which are expected to be
detected or ruled out by near future observations.

Dark Forces (physics colloquium)

Physics of dark matter and dark energy, discovered via their gravitational
interaction, may hide further surprises. In my talk, I will review recent
developments with direct and indirect searches of dark matter that perhaps
give us a hint on the existence of "dark forces".The search for dark forces at
the new luminosity frontier will become an important part of modern particle
physics. I will discuss some of the recent theoretical and experimental
developments in this field.

Multi-field DBI inflation: primordial perturbations and non-Gaussianities

In this talk I discuss some aspects of multiple-field inflation, and more
specifically so-called Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)  inflation. DBI inflation
emerges when one tries to embed inflation in a string-theory setting, and is
based on the motion of a brane in a higher dimensional space-time: the
directions in which the brane can move correspond to the different
inflationary fields. We discuss the (correct!) action for DBI-inflation and
then calculate some of its observational cosmological consequences,
particularly for non-gaussianities in the CMB.

The impact of the last 13 billion years and of the first 10<SUP>-35</SUP> seconds on the CMB (physics colloquium)

Beyond its revelations to date on the structure, dynamics
and contents of the universe, the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) radiation has more physical data to be mined. We describe
two experimental approaches designed to complement the reach of
the WMAP and Planck satellites. The first is the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT) project. ACT is mapping the CMB sky
in three frequency bands (145, 215 and 265 GHz) with a resolution
5-10 times better than that of those satellites. The fine-scale
anisotropy of the CMB reflects the primordial power spectrum of
density fluctuations, but also encodes details of its interactions
with the rest of the universe in its 13-billion-year flight.
Moreover, these details depend on fundamental quantiites of
the universe including the mass of the neutrino, the equation of
state of the dark energy, and the nature of the dark matter.
The second experimental approach we describe is measurement of
the large-scale polarization anisotropy of the CMB; we will
mention both the QUI ExperimenT (QUIET) and the Atacama
B-mode Search (ABS). Gravitational waves generated during any
inflationary epoch (in the first 10 atto-attoseconds) can
give rise to a specific pattern in the tensor field of the
CMB polarization observed on the celestial sphere, dubbed
B-modes, which has no other primordial source.

Two ways to derive a spacetime in quantum gravity

I will give a short introduction to the problem of quantum gravity
and will discuss two approaches to solving it. Both of these
approaches can be seen as problems in statistical / condensed matter
physics, where the task is to derive general relativity as the
effective theory. The first, causal dynamical triangulations, is a
new universality class of statistical systems with microscopic
causality whose properties lead to a dynamical derivation of the four
dimensions of our spacetime. The second, quantum graphity, is an
extension of the Levin-Wen string network condensation to a model of
emergent locality and matter.

Mining for Extra-solar Planets with a Bayesian MCMC Kepler Periodogram

Are we on the threshold of discovering life elsewhere in the
universe? With the mounting discoveries of extra-solar planets there
is a sense that we are well underway. Astronomers searching for the
small signals induced by planets inevitably face significant
statistical challenges.  This talk illustrates how a Bayesian
re-analysis of published radial velocity data sets is providing strong
evidence for additional planetary candidates. The Bayesian nonlinear
model fitting is accomplished with a new hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo
(HMCMC) algorithm which incorporates parallel tempering, simulated
annealing and  the genetic algorithm. Each of these components facilitate
the detection of a global minimum in &chi;<SUP>2</SUP>. By combining all
three, the HMCMC greatly increase the probability of realizing this goal
in a blind search of the parameter space. When applied to the Kepler
problem it acts as a powerful multi-planet Kepler periodogram for both
parameter estimation and model selection. The algorithm is embedded in
a unique two stage adaptive control system that automates the tuning
of the MCMC proposal distribution parameters through an annealing
operation. The HMCMC algorithm is very general and applicable to many
other nonlinear model fitting problems.

Gravitational wave constraints on multi-brane inflation

The vanilla model of DBI-inflation has essentially been
ruled out by the WMAP 5 year data. The generation of large
non-Gaussianities and a detectable level of tensor perturbations are
incompatible.
In this talk I will discuss a phenomenological class of non-canonical
inflationary models that could yield both a large level of
non-Gaussian perturbations and a detectable tensor spectrum. I will
then discuss how this model can be realised in a string theory
setting.

Probing pseudoscalar perturbations with CMB polarization

I'll discuss the use of CMB polarization as a probe of new light
pseudoscalar degrees of freedom weakly coupled to photons. The
stochastic pseudoscalar fluctuations generated during inflation
provide a mechanism for converting E-mode polarization to B-mode
during photon propagation from the surface of last scattering.
The efficiency of this conversion process is controlled by the
dimensionless ratio H/(2&pi; f<SUB>a</SUB>), where H is the Hubble
scale during inflation, and f<SUB>a</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP> is the
strength of the pseudoscalar coupling to photons. The current
observational limits on the B-mode constrain this ratio to be
less than 0.07, which in many models of inflation translates
to a sensitivity to values of f<SUB>a</SUB> in excess of
10<SUP>14</SUP> GeV, surpassing the sensitivity of other tests.

Gravitational approaches to cosmic acceleration (physics colloquium)

Among the possible explanations for the observed acceleration of the

physics might be the culprit. In this colloquium I will discuss some
of the challenges of constructing a sensible phenomenological extension
of General Relativity, give examples of some candidate models of
modified gravity and survey existing observational constraints on
this approach. I will conclude by discussing how we might hope to
distinguish between modifications of General Relativity and dark energy
as competing hypotheses to explain cosmic acceleration.

Late Forming Dark Matter

Similarity of energy densities of dark matter and dark
energy at the present epoch motivates us to inquire about an unified
view of these two, i.e. to ask whether the same substance can behave
as dark matter at early epoch and make a transition to dark energy at
later time. I will discuss how neutrino physics can give us such
scenario where dark matter is formed at much later time unlike weak
scale neutralino and in particular I will discuss its cosmological
signature in large scale structure formation and its possible decay to
light fermions like neutrino.

Detecting massive star-forming galaxies at z>1 using BLAST and SCUBA-2 submillimetre wavelength surveys

We currently believe that we live in a Universe whose mass
distribution is dominated by cold dark matter. This model does a
remarkable job of explaining how the mild inhomogeneities in the
primordial plasma, imprinted on the Cosmic Microwave Background,
evolved into the complex web of large-scale structures observed in the
local Universe. However, we are only just beginning to understand the
details of how smaller objects such as stars, galaxies and clusters
formed and evolved within the gravitational potential of dark matter.
A crucial step in this process is to map out the distribution of
light-emitting matter with redshift. While optical surveys using the
Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based optical telescopes in the
1990's made great progress detecting "normal" galaxies to high
redshifts (z>1), it has become clear during the last decade that
longer wavelength studies in the IR--mm regime are required to detect
galaxies in their earliest stages, as they are often optically
obscured by dust, and hence absent from even the deepest optical
images. I will discuss some recent Balloon-borne Large Aperture
Submillimeter Telescope (BLAST) results from our 2006 campaign from
McMurdo, Antarctica. I will also cover future surveys with the SPIRE
camera for the Herschel Satellite, and the SCUBA-2 camera that will
operate on the 15-m James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii.

String theory and the very early universe (physics colloquium)

The inflationary universe scenario is the current paradigm of early
universe cosmology. However, current realizations of inflation suffer
from some serious conceptual problems. Superstring theory provides the
framework for developing a new theory of the very early universe. I will
discuss a new cosmological model ("string gas cosmology") which is based
on a number of key ingredients of superstring theory. According to this
model, the universe began not with a phase of inflation, but as a hot
string soup, and the cosmological inhomogeneities we can measure today
were seeded by thermal fluctuations of this gas of strings.

A Singularity Problem with f(R) Dark Energy

I will talk about a curvature singularity problem appearing on
non-linear level that generally plagues f(R) models that modify Einstein
gravity in the infrared. It is caused by the fact that for the effective
scalar degree of freedom, the curvature singularity is at a finite field
value and energy level, and can be easily accessed by the field dynamics
in the presence of matter. Consequences for observational viability are
grave: regular static solutions for neutron stars do not exist in many
IR-modified f(R) models. I will discuss whether the theory can be saved
by an UV-completion.

N-body Degravitation

A possible resolution to the cosmological constant problem may
come from the graviton having a small mass or width. In this picture, the
graviton carries extra polarizarions. Its helicity-0 or scalar mode is
suppressed in regions of high density but becomes important on
cosmological distance scales. We are solving the equations for this scalar
component numerically as a part of an N-body simulation. This will allow
us to quantify the impact of massive/resonance gravity on the formation of
large scale structure for the first time.

Restraining Void Models for Cosmological Acceleration

The last decade has seen the compilation of strong evidence that
the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating.  The source
for this acceleration is still a mystery, although probably the
simplest view is that it is caused by a cosmological constant.  One
alternative explanation which requires no new matter fields or
modifications of gravity, but discards the Copernican Principle,
involves a large nonlinear underdensity centred near us.  It is known
that such a void can mimic some of the data by replacing increasing
expasion rate in time with increasing expansion rate towards the void
centre.  I discuss the difficulties that void models face, from the
philosophical to the observational.  I also lay out a general
relativistic framework for the evolution of linear perturbations on a
spherical void background aimed at confronting with data.

Simulating the Big Bang (physics colloquium)

The idea of inflation (a period of rapid quasi-exponential expansion
of the Universe) neatly solves several issues in cosmology. But while
the Universe is inflating, its contents is cold. Eventually, inflation
has to end and the field driving the inflation has to decay, depositing
its energy into high-energy particles. This process, known as reheating,
starts the hot big bang as we know it. I will discuss basic models of
resonant and tachyonic preheating, show recent numerical simulations
of the inflaton decay (which turns out to be quite non-linear and violent),
and explore how gravitational waves are produced in the process. If observed,
they could allow a glimpse of physics at energies we know very little about.

Long-lived relics in warped reheating

The success of the inflationary paradigm has prompted numerous efforts
seeking to realize inflation within the context of string theory.
Warped inflation has, arguably, received the plupart of attention, and
it results in several unique features. The reheating scenario is one
of those features, resulting from a sequence of intermediary steps as
opposed to a direct coupling between the inflaton and standard model
particles. This talk will (briefly) review this unique framework for
inflation and the process of reheating in brane inflation. The focus
will be on the possibility of long-lived relics, and a means of
accommodating their decay. The results are intriguing, and I will end
the talk by breaking supersymmetry, and placing new constraints on the
parameters of these constructions.

Constraints on inflation models which predict cosmic strings

inflation, and the constraints imposed on these models by the recent 3-year

Black Holes and the Problem of Information Loss (CAP Lecture)

Starting from two fundamental principles of physics, namely the maximum
speed of propagation of signals (speed of light) and reference frame
independence of this speed, we arrive at the notion of spacetime continuum
and the metric. When we try to incorporate acceleration or gravity in this
picture, we show that spacetime must be curved. The amount of curvature
depends on the matter content of the spacetime, and is governed by the
Einstein equations. These equations also predict the existence of black
holes - highly dense gravitating objects, from which (classically) nothing
can escape, not even light. When quantum mechanics is taken into consideration,
black holes are predicted to emit small amounts of thermal radiation and
have large amounts of entropy. This also gives rise to the so-called
'information loss problem', which says that information entering a
black hole maybe lost forever, in apparent violation of quantum mechanics.
We explore possible microscopic origins of black hole entropy and
possible resolutions of the information loss problem.

A framework for probing gravity and dark energy on cosmological scales

Departures from the flat-LCDM model can occur in the geometry, expansion
history and the growth of structure. In addition, the relationship between
the non-relativistic matter distribution and metric perturbations depends
on the theory of gravity and any additional fields that are present. This
provides another means of distinguishing the alternatives to LCDM. I will
briefly discuss kinematic constraints on the expansion history. I will
then concentrate on our attempt to develop a framework for probing
the matter-metric relationship on linear, sub-horizon scales in a
scale-dependent manner.

Modified Gravity and its Consequences for Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology

The consequences of a modified gravity (MOG) are explored. The
theory successfully explains the dispersion velocities of globular
clusters, the rotation curves of galaxies, the mass profiles of x-ray
clusters, the Bullet Cluster and cosmological observations without exotic
dark matter. An explanation of the accelerated expansion of the universe is
obtained from the MOG field equations without Einstein's cosmological
constant. I demonstrate how the solutions of the field equations can be
derived directly from the action principle of the theory, without resorting
to ad-hoc parameter choices of empirical formulae. After the values of
integration constants are determined from observation, approximate
solutions to the field equations of MOG are obtained that show excellent
agreement with the data from the scale of the solar system to cosmological
scales. With no undetermined free parameters, the theory can be used to
make firm predictions that may be verifiable in the foreseeable future.

Dark Energy perturbation and its application on cosmology

Dark Energy (DE) is amongst the biggest enigma in modern cosmology. The
nature of dark energy dominates the fate of our universe and the
perturbation of DE plays a crucial role in theoretical study as well as in
the determination of cosmological parameters. 
The latest astronomical observations, including supernova type Ia (SN Ia),
cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS), mildly
favor the equation of state w of DE crossing over the cosmological boundary
during evolution. However, there exists divergence in perturbation equation
when w crosses over -1, which gives rise to the classical difficulty in
global fit of cosmological parameters. In this talk, I will firstly study
the dark energy perturbation in theory and propose a strategy to handle the
perturbation in parameter fitting based on Quintom model. Then I will
investigate the correlations of dynamical dark energy with inflation
parameters, neutrino mass and curvature of space-time. 
The nature of neutrino is another challenge to modern physics. The mass of
neutrino, which is beyond the standard model of particle physics, is of
great significance theoretically. With the latest astronomical data, I will
study the correlation between neutrino mass and inflationary parameters and
the cosmological constraints of mass varying neutrinos. I will show that the
neutrino mass limit can be relaxed dramatically if neutrino mass varies and
mass varying neutrinos are favored at about 3 sigma for some data
combination. This discovery challenges the fundamental particle physics and
cosmology to a great extent.

Scale-dependent growth of structure in viable f(R) theories

f(R) theories are an alternative approach at the phenomenon of cosmic
acceleration, in which the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity is modified
by adding a function of the Ricci scalar, f(R). While at the background
level viable f(R) models must closely mimic LCDM, the difference in their
prediction for the growth of large scale structures can be sufficiently
large to leave detectable signatures in future surveys. In this talk,
after reviewing the conditions for the background viability of f(R)
theories, I will focus on scalar perturbations. I will present in some
details the dynamics of linear perturbations, showing what are the
characteristic imprints of f(R) models in the large scale structure.

The Standard Cosmological Model (physics colloquium)

All empirical evidence relating to our Universe is currently well
explained through a fairly simple model, composed of only a few key
ingredients. The background is described by homogeneous and isotropic
solutions within General Relativity, in which there is domination by
vacuum energy and cold dark matter in a flat expanding geometry. On top
of this background are fluctuations in density which were laid down at
early times and are nearly scale-invariant, adiabatic and Gaussian.
From these low amplitude seeds all of today's structure grew through
gravitational instability. Within this "Standard Model" the Universe in
which we live is described by fewer than 10 numbers, most of which are
now known to at least the first digit. So what is left to do? How well
should we determine the cosmological parameters? Where did these values
come from? Are there more numbers that we haven't thought of yet? Is
this Cosmological Standard Model anything like the Standard Model of
Particle Physics?

Weak Lensing by Large Scale Structure

Intervening structures in the universe give rise to small distortions
in the shapes of distant galaxies. By measuring this tiny coherent
signal, we can study the mass distribution in the universe directly,
without relying on baryonic tracers. This makes weak lensing by
large-scale structures a powerful probe of cosmology. I will review
the topic of "cosmic shear" and discuss how the signal is extracted
from the data. I will present results from recent surveys, most
notably the CFHT Legacy Survey. Finally I will discuss what will be

A scenario of baryogenesis compatible with thermal inflation, and preheating

Most of models of baryogenesis are incompatible with thermal inflation
which is the most compelling solution of cosmological moduli problem. We
propose a simple model in which the MSSM plus neutrino mass term (LHu)^2
is supplemented by a minimal flaton sector to drive the thermal
inflation. Under two very plausible assumptions, this model leads to
thermal inflation followed by Affleck-Dine type leptogenesis along the
LHu flat direction. The conservation of generated asymmetry in this
model is non-trivial since Hubble parameter is negligible at the time of
our Affleck-Dine leptogenesis. We demonstrate numerically that
preheating does efficiently damp the amplitude of the Affleck-Dine field
and that the lepton number is conserved as the result.

Formation of black holes 

I discuss the formation of black holes by spherical domain wall collapse
as seen by an asymptotic observer, using the functional Schrodinger
formalism. To explore what signals such observers will see, I describe
the radiation of a scalar quantum field in the collapsing domain wall
background. The total energy flux radiated diverges when backreaction of
the radiation on the collapsing wall is ignored, and the domain wall is
seen by the asymptotic observer to evaporate by non-thermal radiation
during the collapse process. Evaporation by pre-Hawking radiation opens
the possibility that an asymptotic observer can never lose objects down
a black hole. Together with the non-thermal nature of pre-Hawking
radiation, this may resolve the black hole information loss problem.

transitions between them. In this talk I particularize to the
spacetime with a single compact dimension. The relevant black objects
are the black string, whose horizon wraps the extra-dimensions, and
the localized black hole. The uniform string becomes  unstable if 'too
thin', and decays into a nonuniform state which apparently evolves
until it pinches off and a localized black hole is formed. Currently,
the dynamical evolution remains elusive, thus we are set to construct
the phase diagram of the static solutions. In particular, the
extremely non-uniform black strings are numerically constructed, and
the local geometry near the pinch off is explored.

of our universe. Thus, any candidates for the unified theory of nature
must allow 4-dimensional de Sitter or/and quasi de Sitter solutions.
It is only recent that a consistent 4-dimensional de Sitter solution
was found in string theory by using warped flux compactification and
branes. In this talk I would like to discuss cosmological applications
of models of warped flux compactification.

Globular Cluster Systems and the Early Evolution of Galaxies

Globular clusters are among the oldest stellar populations in the
local Universe, thus providing a unique window onto the earliest
epochs of galaxy formation. As markers of the most intense periods of
star formation, these old, massive star clusters are intricately
entwined with the formation of the galaxies that host them. Some of
their properties, but not all, mirror those of their host galaxies,
and it is from both the similarities and differences that we can gain
insight on galaxy evolution. I will present a view of globular
cluster systems in 100 early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster
Survey, the most comprehensive and homogeneous data set of its type
to date. I will describe some of the main results of the survey,
including the metallicities and specific frequencies of our surveyed

X-ray galaxy clusters as cosmological probes

Late-time cosmic acceleration is currently one of the most
intriguing questions in cosmology. The standard
cosmological model now consists of a present-day Universe filled with
approximately 4 per cent of normal baryonic matter, 23 per cent of
cold dark matter (CDM) and 73 per cent of quantum vacuum energy (the
cosmological constant, &Lambda;) that provides the late-time cosmic
acceleration. However, any departure from this standard &Lambda;CDM
model would suggest either a new energy component of the
Universe, so-called dark energy, or a modified gravity theory,
so-called dark gravity. Using X-ray galaxy clusters we have
developed two independent and complementary experiments to constrain
cosmic acceleration. Our first experiment measures distances to the
largest and most relaxed X-ray galaxy clusters using their gas mass
fraction f<SUB>gas</SUB>. This allows us to reconstruct cosmic expansion
up to z ~ 1. This experiment also provides one of the most
precise measurements of the mean matter density of the Universe.
Combining this experiment with supernovae type Ia and cosmic
microwave background data we obtain tight constraints on departures
around the concordance &Lambda;CDM paradigm. Furthermore we use two
different and complementary theoretical frameworks to explore
departures from &Lambda;CDM. We find that &Lambda;CDM is still a
robust description of current data at about the 1&sigma; level. Our
second experiment measures the growth of structure which is a strong
function of cosmological parameters. We count X-ray galaxy clusters
above both a flux and a luminosity threshold at different redshifts
(z &lt; 0.7) and compare this with precise theoretical predictions of the
mass function. We obtain the tightest constraints to date for a single
experiment on the equation of state of dark energy.

Do quantum excitations of the inflaton decay?

The properties of the primordial perturbations seeded during a stage of
inflation are determined by the quantum state of the inflaton.  This state is
usually assumed to be the "vacuum", since one expects excited states to decay
into the state of lowest energy. In the talk I discuss whether this assumption
holds in the presence of a short-distance cut-off. I describe the calculation of
transition probabilities between excited states and the vacuum, and discuss the
implications of the results that I obtain.

Probing Dark Matter and Dark Energy with weak gravitational lensing

Cosmology is the scientific study of the Universe, striving to answer the most
fundamental questions about its origin, history and future.  Already we know
that only a small fraction of our Universe is made up of the material that we
are familiar with on Earth.  The rest is made up of an unknown Dark Matter
component that surrounds all galaxies, and an unknown Dark Energy component that
is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the Universe.  Measuring the
exact quantities of each of our Universe's components is the great achievement
of modern day Cosmology, revealing a rather sad fate for the Universe; it will
simply expand forever becoming colder and emptier.  That we have no grasp of the
nature and origin of dark matter or dark energy however remains rather
unsatisfactory!

In this talk I will describe a new technique, called `weak gravitational
lensing', that can not only detect dark matter but also has the great promise of
being able to measure the properties of dark energy.  I will discuss the physics
that underpins this method and present maps of the distribution of dark matter
across an area of sky the size of the full moon. I will also describe an
exciting future NASA mission that will utilize this lensing technique to uncover
the origin of the mysterious dark energy.

"The Neutron Star in 1930 -- and Today (special colloquium)

The neutron had not yet been discovered in 1930, but it might have been.
To understand neutron stars simply it is fun to ask how much could have
been predicted about their properties if it had. After using this
fictional device to introduce neutron stars, we will fast forward to
today, where some of the issues remain the same as we could have deduced
in 1930, but others are more subtle -- and potentially revealing about
high density nuclear physics.

"Dynamics of the r mode instability of neutron stars

One of the most important questions in high energy astrophysics is what
sets the fastest possible rotational frequencies of neutron stars.
Although requiring stability against rotational mass shedding set
absolute upper bounds, for most equations of state these seem to be well
above the fastest observed rotational frequencies. The r-mode -- a
Rossby wave in a rotating fluid -- is destabilized via the emission of
gravitational radiation in neutron stars at rotation rates below the
absolute upper bounds. This talk will treat the important topic of how
the instability saturates, which determines whether gravitational
radiation is detectable from neutron stars suffering from this
instability. Moreover, the question of whether the instability is ``too
strong'' will also be discussed -- and what that might mean for neutron
star physics.

Dark Energy and the Rubber Band

There is now strong evidence for an unknown form of dark energy
pervading the universe. However, the microphysical explanation of this
dark energy remains a mystery. The dark energy cannot be a normal fluid,
as this leads to instabilities on the smallest scales. In this talk I
discuss the possibility that the dark energy takes the form of an elastic
medium. I explain the theoretical framework and cosmological signatures
of such a model, and also discuss the possibility that the microphysical
origin is a tangled network of cosmic strings and domain walls.

Aspects of nonlinear perturbation theory in cosmology

I will review recent suggestions that nonlinear cosmological
perturbations are important in slow-roll inflation models. Closely
related issues in pure de Sitter spacetime will also be discussed,
with the upshot that a reasonable notion of perturbative consistency
directly implies a disturbing absence of nontrivial dynamics in de
Sitter spacetime. The scope of the talk will be introductory.

Supersymmetry for particle physicists

The idea of Supersymmetry, together with the theoretical motivations for
its introduction, is presented in a way that puts an emphasis on the
main concepts rather than the technical details. The observational
consequences of Supersymmetry, past searches, existing limits and
prospects for possible observation of Supersymmetric particles in
experiments at Large Hadron Collider at CERN are summarized.

Submillimetre galaxies and star-formation in the early Universe

Submm galaxies recently have been discovered in significant numbers
using SCUBA, the sub-millimetre common-user bolometer array on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope, Hawaii. Their spectra closely resemble 30-40K
black-body; they are believed to be dust-shrouded progenitor galaxies
with the dust heated by UV radiation from early generations of stars. If
this is so, then star-forming rates in each pre-galaxy must be
prodigious, say 1000 solar masses per year. The present day equivalents
are suggested to be the so-called ULIRGs, ultra-luminous IR galaxies,
such as NGC 6240 or Arp 220, whose enormous star-formation rates are
attributed to major galaxy mergers. At last we have a completely
identified sample of 35 submm galaxies, and my talk will describe how
this sample - despite its small size - has enabled us to learn much
about the cosmic space distribution and evolution of this key population
of proto-galaxies.

The role of SUSY flat directions in reheating

Reheating after inflation describes all the particle physics processes
occurring from the decay of the inflaton up to the establishment of
thermal equilibrium. Due to the strong model dependence, it is one of
the most unknown stages in the history of the universe. There is ongoing
effort to determine the reheating temperature within different scenarios
(from this quantity, one can then determine the amount of baryons and of
unwanted relics, such as gravitinos, produced by the thermal bath). It
has been argued that SUSY flat directions are naturally excited during
inflation, and that they slow down thermalization, by providing a large
effective mass to the fields they are coupled to. We discuss a
nonperturbative decay channel for the flat directions which has been
generally overlooked in the literature. It typically leads to a quick
decay of the flat directions, and, arguably, to a suppression of their
delaying effect for thermalization.

Relativistic Binary Pulsars

Radio pulsars in double-neutron-star systems provide the best tests of
strong-field gravitational theories. I will present recent observations
of PSR B1534+12 and the double-pulsar system J0737-3039A/B. In both
cases, the pulsar timing observations are sensitive to multiple
relativistic corrections to the basic Keplerian orbit, and therefore
yield multiple tests of general relativity, with the double pulsar
providing the strongest test to date. I will also discuss observations
of geodetic precession and implications for the formation of the two
systems.

Predictions in Eternally Inflating Universe

In generic models of cosmological inflation, quantum fluctuations
strongly influence the spacetime metric and produce infinitely many
regions where the end of inflation (reheating) is delayed until
arbitrarily late times. The geometry of the resulting spacetime is
highly inhomogeneous on scales of many Hubble sizes. The recently
developed string-theoretic picture of the "landscape" presents a similar
structure, where an infinite number of de Sitter and anti-de Sitter
universes are nucleated via gravitational quantum tunneling. Since
observers on the Earth have no information about their position within
the eternally inflating landscape, the main question in this context is
to obtain statistical predictions for quantities observed at a random
location within the landscape. I describe the problems arising within
this statistical framework, in particular, the need for a volume cut-off
and the dependence of certain cut-off schemes on time slicing and on the
initial conditions. I review the existing proposals for extracting
predictions and give examples of their applications, in particular, to
the cosmological constant problem.
