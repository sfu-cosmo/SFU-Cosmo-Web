    SFU Cosmology is involved in Planck! After a long year and a half and a lot of hard work from everybody on the project, the new results are out! Visit <A HREF="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications">Planck Publications page</A> for Planck 2015 Results papers.

    <H2 ALIGN="center">Testing Gravity 2015:</H2>
    In January 2015, we organized a three day workshop on various ways of testing gravity - cosmological, astrophysical and terrestrial. This is a topical theme, in part because of the growing interest in modified gravity theories motivated by the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy, and in part by improving technologies that open opportunities for new types of tests. The workshop brought together experimentalists, observers and theorists, with a mixture of invited and contributed talks, and plenty of time for discussions. The meeting took place 15-17 January 2015 at SFU Harbour Center, with a one day school on cosmology and gravity for students will directly preceding the main workshop. Visit <A HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2015/">conference website</A> for talks and photos.
