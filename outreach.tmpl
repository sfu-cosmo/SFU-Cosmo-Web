    <H3>Dr. Andrei Frolov  -  <I>"The Beginning of the Universe"</I></H3>
    
    The Universe is now about 14 billion years old. We can see the hot glow of
    its younger days in a form of cosmic microwave background radiation. That
    light is coming to us from the time it was about 400,000 years old. We have
    a pretty good idea how Universe was expanding when it was three minutes old
    from abundance of elements produced during nucleosynthesis. But what was
    there before that? And how are we going to find out? In this talk, I will
    describe the current paradigms of theoretical cosmology, inflation and the
    Big Bang model, discuss what observational evidence we have to support our
    views, and mention some of my own work on reheating of the early Universe.

    <H3>Dr. Ray Villard  -  <I>"Discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope"</I></H3>
    
    The Hubble Space Telescope was released from the Space Shuttle in 1990 and
    from its perch high above the Earth's light absorbing atmosphere has proved
	to be one of the world's foremost astronomical tools;  providing proof of
	the age of the universe and its expansion rate.  Along the way the HST has
	shown, with striking photos, the beauty of the universe in which we live
	and views of our planetary neighbours that rival those of planetary space
	probes.
