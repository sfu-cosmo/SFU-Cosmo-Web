    The Hubble Space Telescope was released from the Space Shuttle in 1990 and
    from its perch high above the Earth's light absorbing atmosphere has proved
	to be one of the world's foremost astronomical tools;  providing proof of
	the age of the universe and its expansion rate.  Along the way the HST has
	shown, with striking photos, the beauty of the universe in which we live
	and views of our planetary neighbours that rival those of planetary space
	probes.
