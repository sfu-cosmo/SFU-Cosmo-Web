    The cosmic acceleration could be caused by some type of repulsive Dark
    Energy or be a manifestation of Gravity obeying different laws on largest
    scales. <B><A HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/~levon/">Levon Pogosian</A></B>
    (SFU) works on developing tests of Dark Energy that will maximally utilize
    the information contained in the data. He also studies some of the models of
    modified gravity with the focus on their predictions for the clustering of
    cosmic matter. Future telescopes will be able to track the evolution of
    clustering back in time. His research involves understanding the
    capabilities of planned and proposed observations and making detailed
    forecasts of the extent to which they will help us be distinguish between
    different theories.

    The Brane Inflation scenario is a working example of how inflation can be
    realized within the framework of String Theory -- a leading candidate for a
    fundamental theory of all particle interactions. What may help to
    distinguish Brane Inflation from other inflationary models is the special
    type of cosmic strings, the F- and D-strings, that form in brane-anti-brane
    collisions. Part of my research involves studying the non-trivial properties
    of the (F-D)-networks and identifying their observable features, such as the
    signatures they would induce in the polarization of the cosmic microwave
    background radiation.

    <A HREF="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~psutton/">Patrick Sutton</A>
    (<A HREF="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">Caltech LIGO Laboratory</A>) are
    working on design and evaluation of linear finite impulse response filters
    for data analysis in gravitational wave interferometer detectors. In the
    context of gravitational wave burst searches, where the signal waveform is
    not known and matched filtering is not available, robustness of filter
    performance across a wide range of possible signal waveforms is of prime
    importance. We propose generalized Savitzky-Golay filters for this
    application. In simulations, they exhibit superior detector signal/noise
    performance and timing accuracy over time-domain filters currently used in
    LIGO data analysis.

    Timing observations of accreting X-ray binary systems show luminosity
    modulation at a number of characteristic frequencies. There are several
    existing (and competing) explanations in the literature.

    (<A HREF="http://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/KIPAC/">KIPAC</A>/<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</A>)
    discovered a <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603687">new characteristic frequency</A>
    dependent only on relativistic effects. If observed, it could be used to
    measure black hole parameters and to probe the strong gravity region around
    a black hole. I would like to further investigate characteristic frequencies
    in accretion disks, including pressure and viscosity effects, and understand
    the mechanism that transfers the modulation from the disk to corona, which
    probably involves magnetic fields.

    (<A HREF="http://www.phys.cwru.edu/">CWRU</A>) have found novel types of domain wall
    solutions in systems which have a large continuous symmetry in addition
    to a broken discrete symmetry. What is remarkable about them is that the
    symmetry inside their cores is lower than that of the vacuum outside
    (one normally expects the broken symmetry to be restored inside the core
    of a topological defect). Some related animations can be found at ...
