    (<A HREF="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">Caltech LIGO Laboratory</A>) are
    working on design and evaluation of linear finite impulse response filters
    for data analysis in gravitational wave interferometer detectors. In the
    context of gravitational wave burst searches, where the signal waveform is
    not known and matched filtering is not available, robustness of filter
    performance across a wide range of possible signal waveforms is of prime
    importance. We propose generalized Savitzky-Golay filters for this
    application. In simulations, they exhibit superior detector signal/noise
    performance and timing accuracy over time-domain filters currently used in
    LIGO data analysis.

    Timing observations of accreting X-ray binary systems show luminosity
    modulation at a number of characteristic frequencies. There are several
    existing (and competing) explanations in the literature.

    discovered a <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603687">new characteristic frequency</A> dependent only on relativistic effects. If
    observed, it could be used to measure black hole parameters and to probe the
    strong gravity region around a black hole. I would like to further
    investigate characteristic frequencies in accretion disks, including
    pressure and viscosity effects, and understand the mechanism that transfers
    the modulation from the disk to corona, which probably involves magnetic
    fields.
