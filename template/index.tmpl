    This is it! The final release of the 2018 Planck results using the full mission data was presented on July 17th by European Space Agency and the Planck Collaboration. Visit <A HREF="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/planck/publications#Planck2018">Planck Publications page</A> for Planck 2018 Results papers.

    SFU Cosmology members join <a HREF="https://simonsobservatory.org">Simons Observatory</a>, a new astronomy facility in Chileâ€™s Atacama Desert that will merge and expand existing efforts to explore the evolution of the universe from its earliest moments to today. Simons Observatory will investigate cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation to better understand the physics of the Big Bang, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, the properties of neutrinos, and the formation of structure in the universe.

    <a HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2017/">Testing Gravity 2017</a> is the 2nd Testing Gravity conference hosted by SFU bringing together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of Gravity. The <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2015/">1st Testing Gravity conference held in January 2015</a> was attended by over 100 scientists from 13 countries. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. It is particularly relevant given the recent first detection of gravity waves by LIGO. The conference will provide an opportunity for theorists, experimentalist and observers to discuss new ways of testing GR and some of the alternative gravity theories, taking advantage of improving technologies and new observational windows. Topics will include gravitational waves, pulsars, black holes; terrestrial tests, gravity on short distances; particle cosmology, dark matter; cosmological probes - CMB, 21 cm, redshift surveys, weak lensing; modified gravity theories; quantum gravity and emergent gravity. The school on Wed Jan 25 will feature four lectures providing background into main topics covered by the conference. The conference will take place on Jan 25-28 in SFU Harbour Centre and will feature a pre-conference school for students, invited and short contributed talks, and a poster session.
