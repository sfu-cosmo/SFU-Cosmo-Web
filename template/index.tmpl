    <H2 ALIGN="center">Testing Gravity 2019:</H2>
    
    <a HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2019/">Testing Gravity 2019</a> will be the 3rd Testing Gravity conference hosted by SFU bringing together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of gravity. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. Like the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2015/">2015</a> and the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2017/">2017</a> meetings, Testing Gravity 2019 will feature the latest updates from the gravitational wave detectors, cosmological surveys and other experiments, as well as discussions of recent theoretical advances. The conference aims to provide theorists working on extensions of General Relativity with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers will get a chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test. Wednesday, January 23rd, will feature a "school" with five review lectures given by some of the invited speakers providing background into the key topics covered by the conference. The main conference, January 24-26, will include invited and contributed talks, and a poster session.

    Andrei Frolov, a member of Planck since 2013, shares in the <A HREF="https://gruber.yale.edu/prize/2018-gruber-cosmology-prize">2018 Gruber Cosmology Prize</A>, awarded to <A HREF="https://gruber.yale.edu/cosmology/2018/planck-team">Planck Team</A> and PIs <A HREF="https://gruber.yale.edu/cosmology/2018/jean-loup-puget">Jean-Loup Puget</A> and <A HREF="https://gruber.yale.edu/cosmology/2018/nazzareno-mandolesi">Nazzareno Mandolesi</A> for <I>"for mapping the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation with the ESA Planck spacecraft. Planck measured, with unprecedented precision, the matter content and geometry of the universe, the imprint on the CMB of hot gas in galaxy clusters and of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure, constrained a hypothetical `inflationary' phase, pinned down when the first stars formed, and provided unique information about interstellar dust and magnetic fields in our Galaxy."</I>

    SFU Cosmology members join <a HREF="https://simonsobservatory.org">Simons Observatory</a>, a new astronomy facility in Chileâ€™s Atacama Desert that will merge and expand existing efforts to explore the evolution of the universe from its earliest moments to today. Simons Observatory will investigate cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation to better understand the physics of the Big Bang, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, the properties of neutrinos, and the formation of structure in the universe.

    <a HREF="http://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2017/">Testing Gravity 2017</a> is the 2nd Testing Gravity conference hosted by SFU bringing together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of Gravity. The <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/physics/cosmology/TestingGravity2015/">1st Testing Gravity conference held in January 2015</a> was attended by over 100 scientists from 13 countries. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. It is particularly relevant given the recent first detection of gravity waves by LIGO. The conference will provide an opportunity for theorists, experimentalist and observers to discuss new ways of testing GR and some of the alternative gravity theories, taking advantage of improving technologies and new observational windows. Topics will include gravitational waves, pulsars, black holes; terrestrial tests, gravity on short distances; particle cosmology, dark matter; cosmological probes - CMB, 21 cm, redshift surveys, weak lensing; modified gravity theories; quantum gravity and emergent gravity. The school on Wed Jan 25 will feature four lectures providing background into main topics covered by the conference. The conference will take place on Jan 25-28 in SFU Harbour Centre and will feature a pre-conference school for students, invited and short contributed talks, and a poster session.
